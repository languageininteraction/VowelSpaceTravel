		<h1>About Vowel Space Travel</h1>
		<p>VowelSpaceTravel is a game that helps the player to learn sounds from a foreign language. The exercices adapt automatically to the level of the user, so that they are challenging while remaining doable. The player moves through a kind of galaxy where he can select planets in order to practice the vowels.</p>
		
		<h1>Language in Interaction Project</h1>
		<p>VowelSpaceTravel was developed within the research consortium <a href="http://www.languageininteraction.nl">Language in Interaction</a>, which aims to explain variation and similarities in languages as well as in linguistic skills. The consortium aims to gain understanding of how such a large range of (cultural) differences have arisen from a biological basis that is common to all people.</p>
        
        <p>The research program examines human language from the level of genetics to interactions between conversational partners, addressing a diverse range of topics such as: brain structure and function, language development, evolution, multilingualism, speech production and comprehension, nonverbal behavior, meaning and context, and the interplay of language with other cognitive systems (e.g. memory).</p>
		
        <h1>More language apps</h1>
		<p>
The research results of Language in Interaction are translated into applications for society in areas such as education and health. Currently a range of <a href="http://www.languageininteraction.nl/apps.html">language apps</a> are developed, including games.</p>
